//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS;
//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
BFS;
//If the tree is very wide:
DFS;
//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS;
//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
DFS;
//Finding the shortest path:
DFS; // This is worry! it should be BFS
